The code contains numerical integral comparison between Trapezoidal and Gaussian Quadrature using different number of intervals. It can be seen than Gaussian Quadrature attains the true value faster than Trapezoidal rule. 

Code can be run from the terminal as : /path/to/the/file$ python Integration.py
